Somebody has to start a repository of interesting dataflash logs....

- Need files which are short and sweet.
- Don't trust the XML file format is not going to change.
- I'd love to get logs showing known failures!
- potential uses for the dataflash logs:
 - tuning automated log analysis
 - testing of new flight code in Replay
 - samples for GCS rendering
